What a long way a loving home does for an animal anxious about the environment at a shelter. Even if Cleo has resided in PAWS for more than two years, his anxiety about finding a fur-ever home increases annually, so we’re doing what we can to change that. Cleo is in the cattery here at PAWS for anyone who wants to play with him and get to know him. Cleo just needs time with a cat lover who wants to bring out the best in him. So, what once was a kitten, now a full-grown cat and a candidate for the best decision you’ve ever made, make Cleo among your list of male Puspins to see here."

Cats that have lived in the shelter for some time deserve the most chance to get people’s notice as they are the likeliest to be loving and affectionate in their new environments with their humans.

Cat,Lucy,9,F,"We know that there are loving cat owners out there who are eagerly looking to foster or adopt a cat in desperate need of a home. Make Lucy, a senior female Puspin that has been with us since 2013, your best move. She is raring for a loving single person, couple, or family and promises to be well-behaved as she is no longer an energetic, playful kitten. Think: senior pets are some of the best choices for fur-ever friends. They love cuddles and belly rubs. They are affectionate without being too needy. And they warm up to owners quickly after being adopted. Make Lucy your first choice if you need a well-behaved, house-broken cat. She will shower you with love and gratitude the same."
Cat,Heath,6,M,"Heath was rescued as a kitten in 2016 from a construction site. Two of his siblings were already unresponsive from heatstroke. Now a fully-grown orange tabby ready for a fur-ever home, Heath is dreaming of human parents and siblings who will enjoy his company. Heath wants to be an indoor cat with a house to hide in, high places to climb and poles to scratch. If you want to leave him to his cat bed, that’s fine too. Mostly, Heath just wants a human family to nurture him and love him more than a shelter with limited resources can devote. Be that person who takes Heath in and gives him a loving fur-ever home. You and Heath will be overjoyed to have one another."
Cat,Bridget Boy,3,M,"Okay, so Bridget is male and was only named Bridget because he was found at St. Bridget School, Quezon City, not because he identifies as a female cat (and there’s nothing wrong with that!) Kidding aside, some people love orange tabbies and can’t get enough of them, so PAWS presents yet another example of this type of appealing housecat with the orange and white fur. Bridget is timid and looks tired, so grab some cat toys or treats to perk him up. Cat owners who love cats jumping on the kitchen counters to join in for meal preparations will love Bridget Boy and his curious hunger for culinary treats. But he also has his bored, lazy cat moments, that is, until you invite him to play and cuddle."
Dog,Tiki,3,M,"Thanks to a concerned citizen’s report, Tiki was not killed for “pulutan” (food usually paired with alcoholic drink). Barangay officers foiled plans of construction workers who were about to slaughter him and criminal charges were filed by PAWS. Tiki remained a sweet, loving dog all throughout his ordeal -where he was only given scraps for food and drank rain water from a puddle near his chained area. When he was rescued, he wagged his tail non-stop and was very excited to get into the vehicle that would take him to the PAWS shelter. Tiki holds no grudges and wants to be friends with everyone he meets for the first time. he epitomizes the saying. ” To err is human, to forgive, canine” and reminds us why we should all work together to end the cruel and illegal dog meat trade in our country."
Dog,Pumi,3,F,Pumi was rescued by a celebrity supporter of PAWS who spotted the poor dog inside a barangay pound cage while she was shooting a television show. Pumi is shy and gentle but she is easily startled by loud noises. We are looking for someone who understands that overcoming traumatic life experiences is tough and may take time; someone who can assure Pumi that she will always be safe and that she will never be abandoned
Dog,Mita,5,F,"PAWS rescued Mita at Ermita Center after she had wounds in some parts of her body.  A small dog who is quiet and adorably well-behaved, Mita is an Aspin that shows discreet affection and is perfect for someone who wants a well-rounded, well-behaved companion."
Dog,Magdalena,2,F,"Magdalena or sometimes we called her “Magda” was rescued from Gilmore at Carmel of St. Therese of the Child Jesus along with her 4 babies namely: Josiah, Jonas and Ezra, Ezekiel. She’s small aspin with Bob tail. Magda is friendly and well-behaved dog that fits to your house."
Dog,Meldy,1,F,"If you are the type of dog owner that wants a 1-yr-old female Aspin that stays quiet at home, try to get to know Meldy. Meldy may be skittish and easily excited or nervous, but with the right home, she will calm down and get used to the love and care of a quiet human. Retirees will love Meldy as she can be a solo dog who stays indoors all the time. Meldy will bark and alert her owners to intruders, as she is sensitive and easily anxious. The rest of the time, she will stay at home with her loving human parents and wait for pets and treats. Take a chance on Meldy, our female Scooby Doo."
Dog,Post,1,M,"Just like a Facebook post by a pal, Post is easy to heart or like. He is a smart, trainable 1-yr-old Aspin who is still a bit skittish in unfamiliar surroundings. But just give him some time and love, and Post will show you his true, affectionate self. Post was just recently rescued is a post office and we hope that he doesn’t wait too long for forever. He desperately needs a buddy or a family that will shower him with warmth and assure him that all is well in the world. We know that somewhere out there, there’s a human that can make him smile more often and show him that he has nothing to fear. We hope they get to meet at the PAWS shelter someday!"
Dog,Blessing,8,M,"It was such a blessing to be able rescue this beautiful aspin, Blessing, from a hit-and-run incident in Anonas, and to restore him back to health. Blessing is a highly energetic dog that needs time to bond with humans, being a 8-yr-old rescue that has been through rough times. Here, at PAWS, he is getting a second chance as our volunteers work to socialize him further. We’re hoping that a foster parent or adopter will appreciate how far he has come and give him the chance to continue his rehabiliation in a home setting. When visiting the shelter to choose as new furry companion, please don’t count him out. He is getting old in years but still has plenty of zest, and he is ready for his forever."
Dog,Banoi,5,F,"When Banoi shows you her happy face, you will surely be won over with delight. A 5-yr-old Aspin rescued in Marikina City during typhoon Ulysees, Banoi has been through difficulties in her life, but it does not change her friendly temperament. She loves pets and goes crazy for treats. She’s a happy, friendly dog who is also quite chill and not overly needy."
Dog,Whitey,6,M,"Whitey may have looked like a healthy and happy stray dog, but in truth, he was in great pain. Someone attempted to castrate this poor boy by tying a rubber band tightly around his testicles. Thankfully, he received treatment at the shelter and is now fully recovered. Whitey is learning to trust humans again, and now he’s looking for a strong pack leader to give him a home."
Dog,Walter White,2,M,"Walter White was not yet born when he was rescued. That’s right! His momma, Menchie, was rescued inside UP Campus when she was pregnant. Because of Walter White’s shy nature, he’s the only one of his siblings still at the shelter. We hope that someone out there is willing to be his patient and dedicated best friend to help him become the friendly and playful doggo that he’s meant to be."
Dog,Usagi,2,F,Usagi belongs to a litter of 5 puppies called the “Sailor Moon pups.” They were found wandering near the Manila Bay area during the lockdown in 2021. She is a friendly and energetic pup looking for someone to be her constant companion.
Dog,Haley,4,F,"When Haley, a hit and run victim, was found underneath a parked car, our volunteer rescuers were unsure if she would make it. After being treated for her injuries, our shelter vet was unsure if she would walk again. Haley also remained aloof for a while, and we were unsure if she would ever get over her fear. Well, Haley put all our uncertainties to rest by bouncing back and being one of the friendliest dogs at the shelter. We’re SURE that she’ll make the best canine companion ever!"
Dog,Tali,3,F,"If you look closely at her “before” photo, you’ll see a deep line around her neck that looks like a collar. That is in fact a deep laceration caused by a rope tightly wound around her neck. The close up photos are a bit too graphic to post. No wonder she was cowering inside a box and hiding from our volunteers when she was rescued. Until now, it will take a bit of time and patience for new people to earn her trust."
Dog,Menchie,9,F,Menchie was seen wandering around UP Campus with an electrical wire wound tightly around her neck. It wasn’t obvious at the time of rescue but she was also pregnant and gave birth immediately after being rescued. She is a very calm and gentle senior dog who gets along with everyone.

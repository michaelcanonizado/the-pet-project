Kidding aside, some people love orange tabbies and can’t get enough of them, so PAWS presents yet another example of this type of appealing housecat with the orange and white fur. Bridget is timid and looks tired, so grab some cat toys or treats to perk him up.

That is in fact a deep laceration caused by a rope tightly wound around her neck. The close up photos are a bit too graphic to post.
